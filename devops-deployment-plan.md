# DevOps & Deployment Plan: MusicCompass

This document outlines the plan for the DevOps and deployment strategy for the MusicCompass application.

## 1. Core Technologies

*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Deployment (MVP):** Heroku
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## 2. Development Environment

*   **Docker Compose:** We will use `docker-compose` to set up a local development environment.
*   **Services:**
    *   `frontend`: The React application.
    *   `backend`: The Node.js API.
    *   `database`: The Neo4j database.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Ensures a consistent development environment for all team members.
    *   Simplifies the process of starting and stopping the application services.

## 3. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

*   **GitHub Actions:** We will use GitHub Actions to automate our CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **On push to `main` branch:**
        *   Run linting and formatting checks.
        *   Run unit and integration tests for the backend.
        *   Build the frontend and backend Docker images.
        *   Push the Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry).
        *   Deploy the new images to Heroku.

## 4. Deployment (MVP)

*   **Platform:** Heroku
*   **Heroku Add-ons:**
    *   We will use a Neo4j add-on (e.g., GrapheneDB) for the database.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Create a Heroku application.
    2.  Provision the Neo4j add-on.
    3.  Configure the environment variables for the backend (database connection, etc.).
    4.  Set up the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy to Heroku.

## 5. Post-MVP Scalability

*   **Cloud Provider:** As the application grows, we can migrate to a more scalable cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
*   **Kubernetes:** For a large-scale deployment, we can use Kubernetes to orchestrate our Docker containers.
*   **Managed Services:** We can use managed services for the database (e.g., Neo4j AuraDB) and other components to reduce the operational overhead.

## 6. Development Steps

1.  **Dockerfiles:** Create `Dockerfile`s for the frontend and backend services.
2.  **Docker Compose:** Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for the local development environment.
3.  **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Create the CI/CD workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory.
4.  **Heroku Setup:** Create the Heroku application and provision the database.
5.  **Deployment:** Configure and run the first deployment to Heroku.
